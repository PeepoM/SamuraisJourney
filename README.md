# SamuraisJourney

Samurai's Journey is a prototype adventure jumping game made in vanilla JavaScript, inspired by the old-school Mario Bros game made in the early 80s which I am a huge fan of. The creation of this game was fuelled by my desire to achieve a goal I originally set for myself when I started learning to program.

The game can be played through this link:
